Deep-Learning Project
This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict which countries are likely to generate high sales orders for McDonald’s. By leveraging historical sales data along with country-level socio-economic indicators such as GDP, population, store count, and marketing spend, the model helps inform global expansion, supply chain optimization, and targeted marketing strategies.

🚀 Key Features
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Regression and classification model development
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
4. Country-level insights into order patterns
5. Model evaluation using RMSE, R², and confusion matrix

🛠️ Technologies Used
1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree

Business Use Case
1. Enable McDonald’s teams to:
2. Forecast demand by country
3. Prioritize high-potential regions for investment
4. Improve decision-making on supply chain and logistics
